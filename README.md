# VALORAE — Static Website

This is a 5-page static website (HTML/CSS/JS) with a luxury black & white aesthetic.

## Files
- index.html
- about.html
- projects.html
- services.html
- contact.html
- assets/style.css
- assets/script.js

## How to use
1. Extract the zip.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
3. To host on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a repo named `yourusername.github.io`
   - Upload all files to the repo root (or push via git)
   - GitHub Pages will serve the site at `https://yourusername.github.io`

## Replace content
- Edit the HTML files to replace project texts, images, and contact details.
- For a custom domain, create a `CNAME` file with your domain name and add it to the repo root, then configure DNS to point to GitHub Pages.

## Notes
- The contact form is a demo; replace with your preferred backend or a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
- Fonts load from Google Fonts, so an internet connection is required to fetch them.
